üß± CNN Architecture
The model includes:

Two convolutional layers to extract image features.

Two max pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.

A flatten layer to convert 2D data to 1D.

A dense (fully connected) layer for learning complex patterns.

A softmax output layer for classification into 10 categories.

‚öôÔ∏è Model Compilation and Training
Optimizer: Adam ‚Äì adapts the learning rate during training.

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy ‚Äì suitable for multi-class classification.

Metric: Accuracy ‚Äì evaluates how well the model performs.
The model is trained over a few epochs and validated on the test dataset. The result is a high-performing model capable of achieving over 97% accuracy with minimal tuning.

‚úÖ Outcome
The trained CNN can accurately recognize handwritten digits, making it a strong foundational project for learning computer vision and deep learning concepts.
